# Lab 3 - Grove Touch Sensor Experiment 
## Introduction
Using the TTP223-B touch detector IC, the Grove Touch Sensor measures the capacitance of a metallic pad. This sensor enables you to replace press with touch. It can detect the change in capacitance when a finger is nearby. That means no matter your finger directly touches the pad or just stays close to the pad, the Grove Touch Sensor will output HIGH.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).

## Dependencies
- NXP FRDM K64F development board
- Grove Shield
- Grove Touch Sensor
- Keil Studio Cloud IDE
